+How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
+=====
+Firstly, it saved a lot of time as the diff pointed out the exact changes. Secondly, it showed the old and new version side-by-side, which made it very easy to compare.
+
+
+
+How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
+=====
+The first thing that comes to mind is the ability to analyze previous changes to detect bugs. The second thing is being able to roll back to a point in time and revert to a working version. Lastly, I will be able to make changes with more confidence and remove pieces of code instead of commenting them out.
+
+
+
+Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
+=====
+Because they have a different purpose. Plus, in Google docs you can't be working on 2 files at once; the documents are not connected.
+
+
+
+How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
+=====
+You can use git log to grab the id of a commit (and the previous one). You can compare that commit with the previous using git diff andd see what changed.
+
+
+
+How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
+=====
+If we break the code or introduce a bug we can always rollback by checking out.
+
+
+
+Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
+=====
+Everything?
