When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
=====
All the time - a remote repository can act as a backup in case my local files are delete or my computer breaks down.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
=====
Because it can be that the same files are modified on Github and locally, therefore there might be a merge conflict.
It's true there might be a conflict in the future anyway, but this way we only have to deal with it once.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
=====
A fork makes a new repository & makes a clone. A clone is a copy of a repository & it's history, while a branch is just a way to make isolate changes on a repo.
It's a good idea to use a fork when you want to make changes to a repository that you don't have access rights to.
A clone will be sufficient to make changes with the proper access rights. Sometimes you might want to make a clone just to run the code in a repo.
A branch can be useful locally, when you want to add a new feature.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
=====
We can pull changes locally without merging - for example if we are working on a certain feature that is not finished, we can wait for the merge until done.
This can come in handy when we know we won't have a internet connection later.



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
=====
I don't see a easier part, perhaps not having to know about all the Git concepts...?
It would be harded to keep track of who changed what (and when). Also, it would be harder to go back and fix bugs.
Lastly, it will be harder to develop features in parallel.
