When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
=====
All the time - a remote repository can act as a backup in case my local files are delete or my computer breaks down.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
=====
Because it can be that the same files are modified on Github and locally, therefore there might be a merge conflict.
It's true there might be a conflict in the future anyway, but this way we only have to deal with it once.
